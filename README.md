# 👋 Hi, I'm Laura

I'm an **Electronic Engineer with a minor in Design turned Full-Stack Developer**, combining systematic engineering thinking with a passion for building software people can actually use.

**Why web development:** After working in automotive engineering, I realized my 
favorite part wasn't just solving technical problems, it was creating solutions you 
could interact with. Web development gives me that immediate feedback loop: design the logic, build the 
interface, watch it work.

### What I bring from engineering:
- **🔍Systematic problem-solving and methodical debugging :** My experience taught me how to troubleshoot complex systems under pressure. 
- **🧪Quality-first mindset and  attention to detail:** in automotive, "works most of the time" isn't acceptable, I've learn to love tests .
- **📊Architectural thinking:** I design database schemas and application logic like I designed circuits: clean, logical, and scalable. My degree project involved building a data processing system with Python and BigQuery

**My approach:** I enjoy the full stack "from database design to frontend" interfaces. 
For me, great code needs logic, clarity, and proper testing. Another think about me: I like to learn constantly (currently: 
React and TypeScript, but also Mandarin and German in my free time, just because).

**What I'm looking for:** Backend or full-stack developer roles where I can 
apply engineering rigor to real products, work with quality-focused teams, and continue growing in a dynamic tech environment.

## 📚 In Active Development

<summary><b> Modern Frontend Frameworks - React, TypeScript & Angular </b></summary>  

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,typescript,angular)](https://skillicons.dev)

 <details>
As part of continuous learning, I'm expanding into modern frontend frameworks (Angular+React)
while maintaining strong fundamentals in vanilla JavaScript.

**Learning highlights:**
- Component-based architecture
- TypeScript for type-safe frontend development
- RxJS for reactive programming patterns
- Planning full-stack integration with existing FastAPI backend

**Status:** Actively in development
