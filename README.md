## 🚀 How to Run These Projects

Each project folder contains its own setup instructions. Generally:

### For Frontend Projects (1 & 2):
```bash
# Just open the HTML file in a browser
open index.html
```
### For Backend Project (3):
```bash
#cd 3_CRUD_api_mysql_python/
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Configure .env file with database credentials
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 🔮 :soon: **Next Steps**
1. Complete Angular module and integrate with existing backend
2. Add testing to all projects (Jest for frontend, pytest for backend)
3. Containerize applications with Docker
4. Deploy projects to demonstrate live applications
