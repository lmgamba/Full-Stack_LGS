I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a foundation in Electronics Engineering. I apply engineering principles including systematic problem-solving, architectural thinking, and quality rigor, to develop efficient, well-structured web applications.
I enjoy the entire process, from discussing business logic and designing the database schema to implementing the frontend interface. For me, great code is a blend of logic, clarity, and teamwork.

Below, you'll find a collection of my hands-on projects that showcase this journey.

## 📚 In Active Development

<summary><b> Modern Frontend Frameworks - React, TypeScript & Angular </b></summary>  

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,typescript,angular)](https://skillicons.dev)

 <details>
As part of continuous learning, I'm expanding into modern frontend frameworks (Angular+React)
while maintaining strong fundamentals in vanilla JavaScript.

**Learning highlights:**
- Component-based architecture
- TypeScript for type-safe frontend development
- RxJS for reactive programming patterns
- Planning full-stack integration with existing FastAPI backend

**Status:** Actively in development
